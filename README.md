# Sphase Invaders

## Description

This is my first attempt at making my very own pixel art-style game using [Phaser](https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/getting-started/what-is-phaser).
I will be implementing the game logic first and then make my own pixel art characters and objects to spice things up.
Entirely developed by my self, in my own free time :sunglasses:

## How to build

I developed the project using Phaser in TypeScript using Vite to build the project.
As such, running `npm run build` will create a `/dist` folder containing all required code and assets.

## How to run

Using simple tools like `serve` you can run the project.
